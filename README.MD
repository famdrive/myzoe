This work is based on https://github.com/jamesremuscat project pyze

My goal was, to write a very flat bash skript which just needs perl and curl, which is both available on Linux systems normaly.

just adapt the credentials file with usernames, passwords and VID Number, and start the zoe.sh with

./zoe.sh 
  or
bash zoe.sh

Output are json snippets.

I may will add parameters for diffrent output formats.
